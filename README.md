# Dog-breed-classification
This project focuses on the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically utilizing the InceptionV3 and ResNet50 architectures, for the classification of dog breeds. Popular datasets like the Stanford Dogs Dataset or Kaggle Dog Breed Identification are employed, and the dataset is meticulously organized into training, validation, and test sets, with images preprocessed for consistency.

The repository provides a comprehensive implementation using Keras, offering practical guides for users interested in dog breed classification. The code includes data preprocessing, model construction, and training for both InceptionV3 and ResNet50 architectures. Leveraging data augmentation enhances model performance. The abstract serves as an overview, summarizing the project's objectives, methodology, and practical applications. Users can fine-tune parameters and choose between InceptionV3 and ResNet50 based on their specific requirements, fostering collaboration and providing a versatile foundation for image classification tasks in deep learning.
